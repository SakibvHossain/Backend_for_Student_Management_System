# Backend_for_Student_Management_System
• Implemented a robust backend system using Java and Spring Boot to create RESTful APIs.    
• Utilized Swagger for clear and concise API documentation, enhancing accessibility experience.   
• Handling exceptions for unwanted API calls.   
• Used Design pattern DTO. DTOs are often used in conjunction with the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture or when working with RESTful APIs. They help in structuring the data exchanged between the client and the server, providing a more efficient and maintainable solution.
